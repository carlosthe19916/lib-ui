[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mturley/konveyor-common-ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mturley/konveyor-common-ui)

TODO:

- Add docs extension for Storybook
- Publish Storybook to GitHub pages
- Test importing the TestComponent into another project via GitHub dependency href? Can we do that?
- Look into automated NPM releases when merging PRs or something like that?
- Add reusable components from mig-ui and virt-ui
- Start actually using the thing
